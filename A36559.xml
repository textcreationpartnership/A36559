            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THe multitude of Books that have already to too much plenared the World with a variety of notions, hath been an Argument of no little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency, to regulate my undertakings; and more particularly, when Imployed about a Concern of ſo great, and of ſo good Importance, by preſenting unto the world a preſident for meditations: but before I did proceed in my undertakings, I thought it abſolutely requiſite to conſult with grave, Learned, and worthy perſons; not only with a particular reſpect to the Author of this Enſuing Treatiſe: (that moſt Heroick, and renowned perſon H. Drexelius) but with a particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:51347:4"/>to this Treatiſe; to whom when I had Imparted my Reſolution, they continued no longer my Incouragers, but preſently became my ſtrict obligers, and ſoon refuted my former objection, and further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that this divine Treatiſe, would he rather a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niter, then a diſcompoſer of pious Meditations. And now Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, give me leave additionally to ſpeak a word or two concerning the Author. He was a perſon not only E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedemically Renowned in Learning, but did Illuſtrate it in the three Theological graces, Faith, Hope, and Charity, and did continually endeavour to ſuppreſs that moſt crying ſin of unſatiable Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs, ſo that you ſee his whole pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage upon this earthly Tabernacle, was an Optick of Vertue and Piety. And he that deſires to know more of the worth of this Author, Let him but read that moſt Excellent piece of his, entituled Confiderations upon Eternitie, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth ſo, I queſtion not but he will be fully Convinced of the truth of what I aſſert, and that it may be as ſeed ſowed in good ground, God out of his Abundant plentitude water it with the due from <hi>Heaven.</hi>

               <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us: and in thy light we ſhall ſee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Wee have a Maſter within us the ſight of Reaſon, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a bright beame, darted from the ſplendor of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,) GOD hath placed in the better and nobler part of man, his ſoule. This light doth not onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh us from beaſts, but advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us to a more noble condition, to a likeneſſe of God: This light ſet up in the ſoule of man is as it were an indelible and ſpeaking Sermon, which ever and anon ſuggeſts this heavenly admonition, <hi>Not to doe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51347:6"/>that to another, which wee would not have done to our ſelves.</hi> For whatſoever wee doe to another, foe, or friend, wee muſt expect the like from him: <hi>with what meaſure yee meete withall, it ſhall be meaſurd to you againe:</hi>

            <p>Sdly, again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> this light demonſtrates unto us both, all things created, and God Almighty the Creator, (though in a darke manner, under a vaile) wanting nothing, moſt perfect, moſt Happy, The everlaſting Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd with a full ſufficiency of all good things, which without want to himſelfe, hee imparts freely to all creatures. The beginning, the midle, and end of our happines, who dwels in light inacceſſible, who is both amyable and powerfull in his works and Graces; whoſe will is his deed, who is all Mercy, and all Goodnes, yet withall an holy, ſevere, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Judge, who cannot be ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſmoothing flattery. The

In compariſon of whoſe Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency all the beauties and faireſt things in this world are meere dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a ſhadow, which is a thing without ſubſtance and reality. To this moſt lovely and excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (I meane God Almighty) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more acceptable, then to be repay'd for all his benefits with the Tribute of our Love and Charitie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This light ſet up within us diſcovers unto us the workes of God our Maker, ſuch as are without us, <hi>viz.</hi> the viciſſitude of times, of night and day, the glorious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſpangled Heaven, the long journeys of the Sunne and Moone, which they diſpatch daily with a ſpeedy motion, the beauty of the earth decked with variety of flowers: The ſpatious windings and turnings of Rivers, the vaſt widenes and furious raging of the Sea, the

            <p>Fourthly, Moreover this light of reaſon enlightned by a cleare and lively faith, diſcovers by an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable demonſtration, that mans fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity conſiſts in this; that hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as much as is poſſible here, to the likeneſſe of God his Maker, which is the only means to purchaſe Gods love and favour; for ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or likeneſſe is the cauſe of love, and that picture is beſt that comes neareſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what is that we ſo much feare ſhould be taken and ſnatcht from us? What is our life but a Scene of mockeries and follies, a ſea of miſeries? Be the ſhippe what it will wherein thou art carryed, bee it made of Gold or of Silver, of precious ſtones, or Wood, thou canſt not avoyd the fury of the waves which will beate againſt it, many rockes ſhalt thou meet with, on many a ſhallow or ſhelfe wilt thou ſticke. Bleſſed and happy is the man who hath ſailed over this Sea; Bleſſed is hee who is eſcap'd the danger of it, and is now in the heaven of ſecurity and reſt. If there bee any (as there are many) who in the middle or prime of their dayes are ſnatch'd out of this life by an unexpected death, they ought no more to complaine of this, then hee that hath ſoone and ſafely paſs'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Sea. Why then doe we feare death which is the end of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the beginning of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: The ſentence of death is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51347:16"/>paſs'd upon all fleſh, by him who is the Iudge of Heaven and Earth. None eſcap'd it in the former ages, and none ſhall avoyd it in thoſe that are to come. Many are gone the way before us, and wee muſt all follow their ſteps Wee were borne with this condition, and are bound by this Law to goe whether all men go, to the Grave. Death is the end of all men, the bound which no man ſhall paſſe. It is a remedy to many who are afflicted with miſery; in that it cures them of their griefe, and tranſlates them to glory. It is the Godly mans wiſh, deſir'd by thoſe who are predeſtinated to everlaſting life, to theſe death gives a releaſe from ſorrowes, and ſets a period to griefe, and beyond which their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and misfortunes ſhall not paſſe. It would bee extreame folly, and madneſſe to reſiſt the decree of a moſt bountifull and gracious Lord, to deny the payment of that Tribute which all do pay, to covet that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is granted to none. The Chriſtians Divinity is of a higher ſtraine, which teacheth us to have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51347:16"/>death in our deſires, and to enjoy our life with patience.</p>

Good God! what a madneſſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes thy vaine thoughts, and yet in the meane time thou ſuppoſeſt death to bee the moſt terrible of all terribles. That which cauſes this folly, this vanity in our deſires, are the delights of the fleſh and earthly pleaſures: for on the contrary he that grones under the burthen of poverty, and griefe, ſuch a man with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> deſires <hi>the wings of a Dove,</hi> that ſo hee may flee away and bee at reſt, being freed from all his miſeries and diſtreſſes. It is with us Chriſtians as with young Birds newly fledg'd, wee are loath to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their warme neſts, but the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they ſtay in it, the weaker they commonly prove, and more unable

            <p>Why doe I tremble at the name of Death? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> why ſhould I feare to dye?

I know whatſoever is undertaken with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, the burden that attends it is leſſend, if not quite taken away, and where the cheerfulneſſe of the will comes, there the vexation, which

For that laſt houre which moſt men ſo dread and feare, is the beginning of that day which ſhall laſt for ever. When a man then is upon his death bed, and feeles the night of death approaching: Let him ſolace himſelfe with theſe words There will come a day which will redeeme me from the darkſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Grave, and reduce me to the comforts of everlaſting life.

I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thee, Bleſſed Saviour, I follow thee in my deſires, which then are moſt earneſt, when I come nearer to thee in any bodily griefe or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51347:23"/>Redeemer. And now Chriſtian Brother, although thou art of a fearefull nature, ſtrive to excite and raiſe thy fainting Spirits with theſe or ſuch like Divine expreſſions. Be ſpeake God in the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David,</hi> and ſay with an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened confidence, and with a ſpirit unappal'd with the feare of Death, <hi>I will receive the Cup of ſalvation and call upon the name of the Lord.</hi> The Cup indeed is bitter,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.12.</note> it hath Wormwood in it, but my Saviour hath ſweetned it, having firſt drank to mee of it when he ſuffered upon the Croſſe for my ſinnes. That Cup is Deaths fatall potion which Chriſt taſted willingly to purchaſe our ſalvation, and all muſt drinke of it without exception. All men muſt, why then ſhould <hi>J alone</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it? who ever hee bee whether Prince or Peaſant, Bond or free, that hath entered upon the Stage of mortality, and hath begun to act his part in this lifes ſinfull Tragedy, he muſt neceſſarily have his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe, he muſt have an end that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51347:24"/>he may begin to Act a better part in the Theater of heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne a new life which nver ſhall have end. Hence then all vaine and idle feares, A way all vexing griefe and tormenting ſadneſſe. <hi>The Cup which my</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Father</hi> puts into my hand, which Chriſt has temperd with his ſweetneſſe, and drank deepe of it, ſhall I not drinke off that; I who am, mortall, whoſe compoſirion tends to ruine, ſhall not I make it my ſtudy and a part of my daily bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to learne to die? wee read that when <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian lay ſick of a deſperate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſome of his friends who were too ſcrupulous had ſuggeſted to him that his Phiſition by name <hi>Philip</hi> intended to give him poyſon in his Phyſick, The King when hee beheld <hi>Philip</hi> comming with his potion, he raiſed himſelfe upon his Pillow, and thus entertained his Phyſition, with one hand hee gave him his friends letters to read, with the other hee took the potion from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51347:24"/>
               <hi>Philip,</hi> And putting it to his mouth hee fixed his Eye; upon the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians face, knowing that if guilt were in his Conſcience, it would diſcover it ſelfe by the ſpeaking blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of his countenance, and when he was fully ſatisfied, that no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe was intended by his Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe face ſpake him not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that it was not ſtain'd with a bluſhing confuſion, the King with great confidence drank up the poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus by Gods grace will I do in this lifes pilgrimage, my Ieſus, my Phyſition, and my ſweet Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath prepard and temperd for mee a Cup, which will caſt mee into a long and ſweet ſleepe: whilſt I drink of it, I will faſten my eyes upon his, and fix my looke upon the gratious countenance of my Crucified Lord: In the which I may read written in the bloody Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his paſſion his exceſſive love to mee, and then with a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr like and cheerfull ſpirit, I vvill drink off the potion, vvhich the more bitter it is, is better for us and the more vvholeſome.</p>

To pretend the care of Wife and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an excuſe that carries with it ſome plauſibility, yet indeed it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced with great folly, ſhall we not for one houre lay aſide all worldly thoughts and diſtempering cares, the care of our Farmes, Oxen, and Wives, and what elſe is deare and precious to us, that ſo we may the better imploy our ſelves in the ſtudy and performance of thoſe things which concerne the eternall good and welfare of our ſoules.</p>
            <p>If wee were call'd to plow or to ſome ſuch toyleſome worke, there would be ſome reaſon for it, if wee ſhould chooſe rather to ſleepe then digge: but being invited to ſit down
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51347:29"/>at a feaſt with Chriſt, where wee have none other food but his owne body and blood, to withdraw our ſelves from this banquet, to ſhunne this Feaſt is certainely a ſigne of an impudent madneſſe.</p>
            <p>If wee did fly from an angry God wee ſhould ſhew that we deſcend from <hi>Adams</hi> race and lineage,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> but to flye from an appeaſed and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God, from a God that invites us with all love and ſweetneſſe to his Table adornd vvith heavenly dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to turne from ſo good a God, is the property not of men but beaſts. But that our excuſes may not vvant their varniſh and colours vve do not palliate and cover our faulty Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vvith filthy and illegall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, vve pretend not our Thefts nor the fouleneſſe of our Adulteries, to be the cauſe of our abſtaining from this heavenly Feaſt: but our excuſe is fram'd and built upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable and honeſt things. For it is no ſinne to marry nor to take care for ones Family, to buy Cattle and purchaſe Land is a point of good
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51347:29"/>Husbandry: But I pray tell mee, what good will all theſe things doe thee, what profit wilt thou reape by them, if in cleaving to theſe thou looſeſt God thy chiefeſt good, and endangereſt thy ſalvation? Wee muſt take care when we pamper the body that we ſtarve not the ſoule, and he that purchaſes a Farme or buyes a field with the loſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a worſe foole, then he was of whom we read in the Goſpell, who cared more for a full Barne then hee did for God.</p>
            <p>When wee are Invited to dine or ſup with ſome great man, we lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all buſineſſe for that time, and whileſt wee converſe with God the King of Heaven and Lord of the Angells at this ſupper of the holy Euchariſt, Farmes, and Oxen, and Wife are to be neglected, all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and worldly cares are to bee ſilenc'd and ſuppreſſed: yet we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times proceed to that impudent bouldneſſe, that we feare not to ſay wee cannot come, we ſhould ſpeake more truly in ſaying, wee will not,

Wee beleeved once the lying Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent perſwading us that we ſhall be Gods, but we give no credence, no beliefe to God, aſſuring us that if we frequent this caeleſtiall banquet.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall be converted and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into his divine nature, through the Sanctification of his bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Conſider what Chriſt promiſeth <hi>He that eateh my fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood,</hi>

            <p>Chriſt commands us to <hi>doe this in memory,</hi> of his death and Paſſion upon the Croſſe, And no doubt his will is that we often do this: We conceive that his praecept is equall and juſt, but we contrary to what Chriſt intended, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration is often to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. All the ancient holy Fathers adviſe us in their writings to come often to this feaſt. Their Counſaile does not diſpleaſe us but our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vitious cuſtome prevaile with us. All the holy Martyrs and Confeſſors in the Primitive times have ſhind before us in their Godly example, inviting us to the practiſe of thoſe Saint-like and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties.</p>
            <p>The light of their piety ſhines in our eyes, but we will not conforme our ſelves to them by a Godly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their vertues.</p>
            <p>But to diſcover farther the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt perverſeneſſe of our natures, let us put caſe, That as oft as A man received the Communion, he were to receive withall a thouſand
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51347:33"/>Crownes: If this condition were annexed to his duty, there were no need of any Rhethoricall expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to allure him, thoſe Arguments dreſſed in Gold would command his obedience by a ſweet force and unreſiſtable violence.</p>
            <p>On theſe termes of conjuring, we ſhould rather want a ſtaffe to keepe the rude multitude off, then a goade to prick them on. Oh the blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of man, we cannot ſee Gold but our affections are inflam'd with a love and deſire of it, becauſe wee conſider not that mine that rich treaſure which is wrapped up and onteinedhidden in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore it is by us entertaind with neglect, and vilified, That vaſt maſſe of Gold in both Indies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard with this unvaluable Jewell, is but dirt and mudde.</p>
            <p>It is beyond the pitch of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt underſtanding to ſet upon it a true value and eſtimation. For by vertue of this holy Euchariſt (or Chriſts body and blood crucified, repreſented to us in it) our ſins paſt of what nature or degree ſo ever are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51347:33"/>blotted out of Gods booke, ſins to come are prevented, the ſtrength of our imbred vitious corruptions is weakned, our underſtanding is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; Our will and affections ſtirred up and incited to the deſire and love of God and goodneſſe, our conſcience is cleard being disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened of its heavy load: And by meanes of it we are furniſhed with ſpirituall Armature againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. It corroborates our Spirits, that we faint not in adverſity; It ſuſtaines and ſupports our natures that wee fall not in proſperity. It confirmes us in the way of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with conſtancy and patience, Laſtly by the holy Euchariſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a pledge of future glory, and by it we get a rich purchaſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death, and deſire of heaven, the moderation of affections, and loathing of our vices, and a love of vertues, the victory over our ſelves, and perſeverance in good workes.

And by ſuch inward and familiar diſcourſes, is God united Intimately to their ſoules. And for this cauſe we make a frequent receiving of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, a ſure and Infalſible ſigne of praedeſtination. If wee come to that ſacred banquet with due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, with hearts purgd from all rantour and malice, and adorn'd with faith and godly purpoſes of new obedience, But for all that is taught us in Bookes and out of the Pulpits, the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſo lull'd aſleepe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with an evill cuſtom that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therexamples of the godly, nor admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitions of Gods Saints can ſtir them up and mould them to a more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe of the Sacrament. Poore ſoules ſuch men are to bee lamented withteares, whoſe hearts are ſo flinty, whoſe breaſts are ſo chill'd and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen as it were with Infidelity, that they ſhun this bright ſhining and moſt glorious Sun, not conſidering
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51347:39"/>that they are deluded by the craft and ſubtilty of Satan who labours by all meanes poſſible to extinguiſh the fire of divine love in us, that wee being as it were ſtiffe with could with the want of love to God, may live like dead men, and dye in our ſinnes, and never come to the land of the living, <q>but hee that loves Chriſt with an ardent affection, deſires nothing more then to bee where Chriſt is ſo ſayes <hi>Caſsido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>

               </gap>oſe high-borne ſoul ſpeaks him to be of a more noble ſtock then to cleave and ſtick faſt in his love to things of the Earth Let every-Chriſtian ſay out of a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Reſolution, I had rather be moſt ſharply pinched with poverty, then in the leaſt manner ſhew my ſelfe to be Gods enemy. I had rather be ſpoild of all my Goods, then want his ſoule ſaving grace, poverty hath beene the cauſe that many have turn'd rich Merchants. not of fine ſilke, nor of ſweet and coſtly ſpices; but of Heaven and happineſſe. <hi>The Kingdome</hi> of heaven (ſayes our deare Saviour) <hi>is like unto a Merchant man, ſeeking precious Jewells, and when he had found one, hee went and ſould all that he had and bought it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Merchant thought it not a loſſe but a great gaine, to looſe all his wealth and ſubſtance. Indeed hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51347:41"/>was no ſooſer but only a ſeller, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by parting with his money he purchaſ'd a gemme of great price and value. He gave to Chriſt in his poore members a little earthly traſh, and for this Chriſt gave him an Acquittance under his hand to repay him in mercy with the reward of heaven. Hee contemned his Gold, and had eternall glory in pawne for it.</p>
            <p>He was ready, if God had beene ſo pleaſ'd, to have forſaken all his Lands and poſſeſſions, and for this willing readineſſe and ſubjection to the will of God, hee has gotten a Kingdome which hath no bounds, being Inſinite and <q>without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and limitation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Hee that has a Jewell in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion (ſayes Chryſoſtome very well) knowes himſelfe to be rich, although it be unknown to others, by reaſon that his Jewell is hid or ſhut up in a bagge.</q> So it is with a faithfull Chriſtian, he knowes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be in a happy ſtate, although the men of the world think otherwiſe from whoſe eyes his faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51347:42"/>vertues are hid. To ſpeake truly, we were ſent by God into this world, to negotiate, not to ſpend our time in florh and riot; and there is none ſo poore and indigent, but may do as that Merchant did, he may make a purchaſe of Jewelſs which are ineſtimable, not to bee prizd or valued.</p>
            <p>Hee that hath gotten Chriſt hath all things, hee has God for his friend who is all in all; A God of mercy and bounty who ſeeks us when wee are loſt, and <q>deſires not our goods but only to ſave us (as St. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſweetly meditates) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and goodneſſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there any that ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in wealth and large poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but that hee may without feare of loſſe throw away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme all thoſe, to procure theſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, theſe gemmes of Gods grace. Yet this Merchandiſe, this trading for Grace, exacts not of us, that actually wee leave and forſake our riches, but that we be in a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or readineſſe of mind, if need be,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51347:42"/>to part with them. The manner of this Negotiation is not to expend all our money, to give away our meanes in a laviſh and prodigall profuſneſſe, but to be ever reſolv'd with full purpoſe of our hearts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have mercy or our ſoules ſav'd, then by ſparing our money to bring them to eternall woe and miſery.</p>
            <p>A good and faithfull Chriſtian had rather bee a beggar then Gods enemy. We muſt not lay downe our ſoule for our money, but our money for our ſoules, eyther by a voluntary or free contribution of it, or by our patient ſuffering, when we are forced to leave or looſe, our Mammon. And hee that can doe this reſigne up his will to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and relye upon Chriſt for the pardon of his ſinnes, that man is praedeſtinated, and is in the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſav'd. And not only the Doctrine of the Apoſtles but even reaſon it ſelfe moves and invites us to this. The Story relates of one <hi>Stilpon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stilton.</note> to whom when his Country was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51347:43"/>his Children ſlaine, his Wife taken from him, and hee only had eſcapt the hands of his enemies, his friend <hi>Demetrius</hi> put this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, asking him whether he had loſt all? <q>I have loſt nothing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed hee, for I cary all my goods all my treaſure about me:</q> So ſaid that Phyloſopher <hi>Bias,</hi>

            <p>To do as the former did, in an Idolater or Heathen man may bee a note or marke of a generous mind but in a Chriſtian 'tis a ſigne that he is praedeſtinate to eternall Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when he can forſake all and follow Chriſt, and count him the chiefeſt gaine, That man is a true ſervant of Chriſt, who being ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd of all his outward goods, yet dares ſay in truth and ſincerity; I beare all my treaſure about mee.

            <p>Thus may a good Chriſtian ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to God, yet withall will he ſay

Riches and plenty to mee, without God is poverty. But why do poore mortall men thirſt after impure and muddy ſtreames, whilſt they pretermit and neglect the foun tame? we have a moſt cleare and ſoule-refreſhing Spring, of which if

            <p>This ſpring or fountaine is God, having him, wee have al things, that can fall within the compaſſe of our deſires.</p>
            <p>If our ſoules ſtand in this poſture with God, if wee eſteeme him our only and chiefe Good, when pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whips us, when fortune frownes on us, although our joy may bee a little Ecclipſed, yet our ſorrow ſhall be much abated, no caſualty ſhall hurt us, and death ſhall not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright us, being out of the reach of both theſe, the only bug-beares of proud diſtruſtfull worldlings.</p>

And what God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a Remedy to prevent ſinne in mee, I ſhall not account that a loſſe, but a great gaine. Why then ſhould I afflict my ſelfe in vaine with griefe and ſadneſſe for the loſſe of thoſe things, which I ever enjoy'd with a mind willing to loſe, and leave them, whenſoever it pleaſed God to ſtrip mee of theſe outward Comforts, and repay mee with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and Inward conſolations?

               <q>To this purpoſe Saint Greg. ſpeakes thus: It happens for the moſt part, that every one who is ordained to eternall ſalvation, is caſt downe and depreſſed with continuall adverſity; is deſpiſed by all men, and thought unworthy of that Grace and favour which the world diſpenſes to thoſe men who have no bliffe, and delight in any thing more then Riches and honour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However the elect be contemned here on earth, yet they are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eſteeme of God, for that they ſhine inwardly with the luſtre of grace and piety. They feare to bee honourd, and think not much to be diſpiſ'd: Their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be pin'd with faſting and abſtinence, yet their ſoules are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51347:51"/>fat and repleniſhd with love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. Their minds are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prepared for ſuffering. And being refolv'd to live and dye in their uprightneſſe and integrity, they rejoyce with exultation when they are loaded with ſcorne and Ignominy.</p>
            <p>Truly the eternall and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Lord God, uſes not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his ſervants with worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights: he tryes them by extremities, hee hardens them by croſſes, and ſo fits and prepares them for himſelfe, yet ſo, that in the meane time hee ſuſtaines and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them with his promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VVhen thou paſſeſt through the waters,</hi> I <hi>will bee with thee, and the floods ſhall not overwhelme thee, when thou walkeſt in the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, the flame ſhall not hurt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, God doth oft-tymes caſt us into the water and fire, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to be dipt in the one, and ſcorched in the other; he makes a tryall of us by the ſummer heat of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51347:52"/>proſperity and the winter froſt of adverſity; but yet thoſe whom he has predeſtinated to life eternall, he will not ſuffer to be drown'd in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or conſumd in the fire. <hi>God is faithfull who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able,</hi>

               <hi>but will even give the iſsue with the tentation that you may be able to beare it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this fifth note of predeſtination: <hi>Ludov.

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This is that ring of ineſtimable price and value, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes upon a ſoule betrothd unto him in a ſpirituall bond of Matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And it is a thing of ſo
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51347:52"/>great worth to ſuffer the leaſt trouble or perſecution for God, that St. Cryſ. is bold to averre it for an undenyable truth, that there is nothing better in the world then to ſuffer for the Glory of God.</q>

            <p>
               <q>We ſee (ſays St. <hi>Greg</hi>) how that Gods elect live vertuouſly, &amp; honeſtly, and yet are perſecuted, they do well and ſuffer ill: from whence we may collect, with what ſeverity the ſevere Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, will puniſh the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and reprobate, ſeeing that thoſe whom he loves are by him ſo ſharply correcttd. Thou art much miſtaken, (O Chriſtian man) if thou thinkſt to goe to Heaven whole and ſound without a bruiſe, and not having a bone broken: Looke about thee with an Eye of attentive obſervation, and thou ſhalt perceive &amp; find that thoſe who

            </p>
            <p>Tis true, that thoſe Beaſts which are deſtin'd to the Shambles, ſport and tumble in fat-paſtures whilſt others are ſweating under the yoke, and toyling in other labours, even ſo men who are aſſign'd by an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree to heaven, they ſport not with wanton worldlings in the faire and pleaſant medows of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, but they lye here and there in corners, bewailing their ſins with ſighs and grones.</p>
            <p>Moſt true is that of <hi>Ludov. Blc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> 
               <q>whom God has decreed to tranſlate to a better life, and to crowne with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he uſes not to waſh with a ſoft and gentle hand, but to plunge over head and eares in the ſalt Sea of Tribulation.</q>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51347:58"/>my Brother, whom he ſuffers to do what he liſt, he loves him better then mee, becauſe, if I ſtirr but one foot contrary to his command, I am preſently whipped and corrected for it; Rejoyce rather when thou art chaſtiſed, becauſe for thee, there is an inheritance reſerv'd, a full, and everlaſting poſſeſſion of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. God ſpares them in this life for a time, whom hee intends to damne to eternall paines. That man paſſes to a Priſon through faire and pleaſant Medowes who poſts to deſtruction, and makes haſt to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, living all his life long in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at eaſe. Some obſerve that Roſes grovving next to a bed of Onions ſend forth a more fragant and delitious ſent.</p>
            <p>And even God that heavenly Gardiner, he hath his Roſes which ſmell moſt ſweetly. Such are men deſtin'd to Salvation, whoſe life and Actions ſavour of God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Roſes God Almighty doth ſo plant in the Garden of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51347:59"/>Church, that for the moſt part they are beſet and begirt with weeds; for the more honeſt and Religious a man is, he ſhall find the more ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even wicked and ungodly wretches, who will boldly aſſault him with divers injuries: and the Godly are ever ſubject to moſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. Thus the fragrancy of of Roſes is encreaſed by the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſtinking Garlick or Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Moreover it is affirmed by others verſed in the skill of Herbs, and Plants, that a Roſe which by A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That man as yet hath not begun to know himſelf who hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the face of his Soule in the glaſſe of miſery and diſtreſſe.</p>

            <p>Hee that hath taſted of Chriſts bitter Cup, hath gotten a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledg.</p>
            <p>Thoſe ſtars ſhine by night which are not ſeene by day in the ſuns bright eye-dazling light. Iuſt ſo, True vertue which appeares not in the noone-tide of proſperity, ſhews its luſtre in the dark night of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. And to ſpeak the truth, God our caeleſtiall Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is not ſo well pleaſd with thoſe ſervants who do with fidelity and carefullneſſe what he commands, as with thoſe who ſuffer Adverſity with patience, And a cheereful reliance upon his Fatherly Goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>The Eagle to make tryall of her young Ones brings them to the Sun and concludes they are of a right ſtamp and breed, if they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his ſcorching beames.</p>
            <p>The Refiner of Silver tryes his mettall by a touch-ſtone, and Chriſt tries his Servants in the furnace of Affliction. Wee may then upon better ground (then the Ancient Romans did) cry out and ſay; To
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51347:60"/>do and to ſuffer hard and difficult things is the duty and property of good Chriſtians. Chriſt our head did go before us in this way of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and we his members muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in the ſame way, with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and Patience.</p>

            <p>This is the conſtant practiſe of many voluptuous worldlings.

               <note place="margin">Cap. 5.1.</note> &amp;c. It ſeems that this religious thirſt, this holy hunger of hearing the word could not be pent nor kept in the Synagogues or Temple alone, nor yet within the Walls of the Citty. It brake forth into the vvide and open fields, there Chriſt found Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. Neither did the men and Women of thoſe times feare the ſolitary corners of the dark deſerts, for they ventur'd to go any where, and follow their teachers with the hazard of their lives. Many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us who dwell nere the Church will not do ſo little as ſtep over their Threſholds not move a foote out of doores to heare thoſe from whoſe Godly inſtruction they might reape benefit to their ſouls and conſciences. They loath nothing more then the heavenly food, and being ſo near to the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51347:64"/>Temple, if they refuſe now to goe to it, can we hope, that they ever wil doe as the primitive Chriſtians did, who many times would looſe their Dinners and Suppers to goe into a Wilderneſſe or ſome ſolitary place, that ſo they might gaine the heavenly repaſt and food for their ſouls.</p>
            <p>In this ſinfull Age of ours there is not ſuch a want of Preachers as hearers, theſe are ſcarſe, the other abound with us. We have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred excuſes to palliate our abſence from the Church, wee bolſter our neglect of Gods ſervice with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſures, and ſome are not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among us, who therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to come to Gods houſe, the Church, fearing leaſt by the loud voyce of the Miniſter thundring out Gods Judgements againſt mens ſinns, their conſciences ſhould be awaked out of the deep ſleep of Security, in which for a long time they have been lull'd, for he that is conſcious to himſelf of any foul ſin and wickedneſſe, feares even
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51347:65"/>himſelf who is his owne Accuſer, Judge, and executioner. The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of his own conſcience is as terrible unto him, as the Bench and Iudge upon it is to a guilty Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

We ſee not that concourſe of people preſſing to heare Gods Law read and preached, they come not with that alacrity to this as they do to ſee a Play, or ſhew, or to gaze at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding paſſing through the ſtreet. If there be a faire at the next Market Town they flock together and run to it, But Gods Meſſengers and Miniſters, if they be not mock'd
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51347:65"/>and flouted, their words are ſlighted, their Doctrine little eſtemed, for which God complains in his word. 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 36. It is not to be denyed That there be many who come to Church and heare Sermons, but this with grief wee may ſay and muſt confeſſe, that there be few who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire from their heart to goe away betterd from the Sermon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in their converſation. They have eares but want hands, they heare and do not. They goe home not one jot the better for what they have heard. There be ſome that come to heare to ſatisfie their curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, ſome to weare away the time, others to obey cuſtome.</p>
            <p>A ſort of men there is who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Church to inform their underſtanding, not to reforme their lives, to get learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, not piety and Religion. There be others that come to ſee, to feed their eyes vvith the aſpect of thoſe beauties vvhich they cannot find in other places.</p>
            <p>Another ſort come to be ſeene,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51347:66"/>and with fleſhly enticements to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure mens eyes to gaze upon them. There are that entertain the words of the Preacher with detraction and deriſion, others come to pratle, ſome to ſleep, or if they keep their eyes open, their eares are ſhut and dull'd with the preſſe of worldly thoughts and cares. There be a few and thoſe good hearers who come with a mind prepared to receive wholeſom admonitions, and draw near to the Preacher for no other end but only that they may return better by his Sermon. The end of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is not to wrangle or diſpute as they do in the Schooles but to win others to Chriſt by a Godly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in their lives. They heare with both eares faſt tyed to the Preacher, and ſlak not in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention til the Sermon be done, at which time they find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ever ſome change and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are more enflamed with the love of God, and moved to an hatred of ſin.</p>
            <p>There is none of ſo feirce a nature
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51347:66"/>and diſpoſition who will not be tam'd and brought to a gentle and mild temper, if he refuſe not inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but lend patiently an eare to the Counſell of a Wiſe monitour. And Chriſts ſheep, as they may be diſcernd many wayes and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers marks from the Goates, ſo they are diſcernable by this, they have an eare-mark which diſcovers them, they heare the word of God with greedineſſe, and practiſe it in their lives, with a conſtant and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall obedience.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are predeſtinate to ſalvation know fulwell what St. <hi>Aug.</hi> truly averreth.
<q>That he is no leſſe guilty that heares the word of God negligently, then he that ſhould take the conſecrated Bread in the Sacrament, and in a ſcornful diſdain trample it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore he that ſpeaketh to us out of the puſpit is not ſo much to be reſpected as he who dictates to the Miniſter, and ſuggeſts vvhat he ſhall ſpeak.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51347:67"/>
            <q>
               <p>What am I (ſayes St. <hi>Aug.</hi>) but the basket of that heavenly Sower who poures into me what I ſow or deliver unto you.</p>
               <p>Attend not the vilenes of the Basket but the excellency of the ſeed, and the power of the ſower from whom the ſeed has its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and vertue, to ſpring up in your hearts and to ſhew it ſelf in your Godly and Religious practiſes.</p>
            </q>
            <p>A Chriſtian is ever learning and never ſtands ſtill, but goes on from one degree of knowledg and grace to another, he delights to fit at the feet of his Lord and Maſter, and with <hi>Mary</hi> to heare his word with that attentive heed, ſo that neither houſhold employments, not a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor Siſters murmuring nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny entreaty of his friends ſhall be able to draw him from the preſence of Chriſt ſpeaking unto him by the voyce of his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Laſtly we muſt conſider, that it is a note of our Election not only to heare the word, but to remember and practiſe what we have heard.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51347:67"/>What good will a mans meate doe him if he caſts it up, ſo ſoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tis ſent to his ſtomack? The Mother of our Lord, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is highly commended as for many other vertues ſo chiefly for this;

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51347:69"/>There is no Sex, on State, no condition or calling exempted by God from hearing of Sermons.</p>
            <p>But thirdly, thou maiſt object and ſay, I am one of the learned, I ſhall heare no new thing, I know before hand what the Preacher will deliver in his Sermon. Here we may diſcover the pride of humane nature which is skilfull and witty to deceive it ſelf. But let me move to ſuch a man this queſtion, who was ever ſo old and learned, who was not ignorant of many things, &amp; might be further in ſtructed? But ſuppoſe thy ſelf to be a man fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all kind of knowledg, and to excell all men ſo farr in underſtanding, that thou canſt not come home more learn'd from a Sermon: But what ſay you to the will and memory, may not it bee mov'd, this ſtirred up and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Does not that ſometimes need to be reformed, this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd and ſtrengthen'd; Nothing ſo eaſy as for the memory to be deceav'd, and for the will to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51347:70"/>miſtakes and errors (embracing evill for good, and ſhunning good for evill) unleſſe both memory and vvill be ſupported by daily helps, vvhereby the former may be made firm, and the other freed from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conceits, that ſo vve may ſerve God, ſincerely in all holines and righteouſneſſe. Therefore it is not only profitable, but alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all men to frequent the Church and to heare Sermons; The wicked have need of preaching that they may be corrected, and their lives amended; The good and Godly that they be not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the Ignorant that they may be taught, the learned that they may be admoniſh'd, that they may learne ſome new thing, or recollect in their memories old things which they have formerly learnd. <hi>A wiſe man will heare and encreaſe in Wiſedom, and the eare of the wiſe ſeeketh learning.</hi> That <hi>Herod</hi> who was ſo famous for his wicked impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet he was not ſo barbarous and fooliſh, but that he would heare <hi>Iohn
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51347:70"/>Baptiſt</hi> his Court Chaplain joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and willingly, and when hee had heard him, <hi>do many things gladly.</hi> In this <hi>Herod</hi> there was not only a willingneſs to heare, but alſo a long and unwearied patience, for he could not have done many things according to Saint <hi>Johns</hi> praeſcriptions, unleſs he had heard him oftentimes concerning divers, and many particulars. Neither are we to imagine that <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt did only repeat, or ſet downe in a Catalogue, and rebuke the Kings vices, but to have dealt with him by Reaſon and Argumentation, that ſo he might not only point at the Tyrants faults, but alſo diſſwade him from them. The adultery of that King, and many other hainous crimes, ſuch ſtaines could not be wiped out by one or two Sermons, each crime required one or more for its purgation. A Soule that is hardned in wickedneſs (ſuch was <hi>Herods</hi>) is to be aſſaulted and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with divers batteries. Thus did <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51347:71"/>all this <hi>Herod</hi> heard him gladly. And although <hi>Iohn</hi> did publikely caſt this in his teeth, and openly affirme to his face, <hi>that it was not lawfull for him to have his Brothers Wife,</hi> and undoubtedly prov'd this by a continued and long diſcourſe, yet <hi>Herod</hi> heard him willingly. Such and ſo great was <hi>Herods</hi> deſire to heare the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt who did not ſpare the Tyrant, did not cover his other ſinnes with the Mantle of Silence. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> witneſſes as much, where he ſayes. <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>the Tetrarch was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked by him for</hi> Herodias <hi>his Brother</hi> Philips <hi>Wife,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 3.19.</note> 
               <hi>and for all the evills which he had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may inferre that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did freely inveigh againſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> tyranny, his many murthers, and Tributes which he had cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly collected and prodigally waſted upon his ungodly Luſt, yet for all this <hi>Herod</hi> heard him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. So great was <hi>Herods</hi> pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at the rebukes of this Preacher, that he was neither offended at his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51347:71"/>firſt Sermon which was more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neither at the ſecond, nor at the third, nor at many others that followed, but ſtill heard him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> never ſeemd to <hi>Herod</hi> to have preach'd too often or too long, neither was he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his plaine expreſſions, or blam'd for his ſharpeneſſe in his bitter Invectives, but <hi>Herod</hi> heard him gladly, and did many things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Baptiſts inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if he had but perſevered, he ſhould have had no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of his unhappineſs; for the Truth was fully revealed unto him, which ſtood him in no ſtead for want of perſeverance. <hi>Seneca</hi> once lamented the want of freedome in declaring the truth in his times.

The mulct ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each default made them look more carefully to their Proviſions of Victual and other neceſſaries. But now in theſe our dayes, if the ſame courſe were taken, many would be found, who had rather feed the Mice then the poor Members of Chriſt. But let me tell them and all men: That there is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a place to which there is an open &amp; eaſie paſſage, in which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mice nor Moths, nor Worms have acceſs.</p>
            <p>It is reveal'd to us by Chriſt in that 6th. of <hi>Mat.</hi> where he ſayes: <hi>Lay up for your ſelves treaſurs in Heaven where neither Moth nor canker corrupteth, and where Theeves neither break through nor

And no mony is loſt but that which we wil not throw away. Neither can any be with more ſafety kept then that which is committed to the hand of thoſe that be in want or need. The bellies of the poor are the rich mans beſt Barnes. Whatſoever is laid up, there ſhal be receiv'd again with uſury, neither is it in danger of fire. If <hi>Abſolom</hi> had in time cut his golden locks, his hair had not prov'd to him an Halter: and if the great ones of the world would but cut out a portion of their mony to the reliefe of the poor and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, they ſhould purchaſe as many friends as they have pounds or ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in their Cheſts, or Purſes: by hoording and keeping their Gold, they do to themſelves this miſchief, they hoord up baits for Theeves, &amp; ſo multiply to themſelves enemies, and encreaſe their dangers.

            <p>The faithfull are liberall, they beleeve Chriſts promiſe and obey his admonition.

But there be ſome and thoſe not predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſalvation, who never give to the poor but with a froward and Malignant heart: Thoſe give with a malignant heart, who only part with thoſe things they cannot eat nor uſe themſelves. If they have in their houſes any ſtinking meat, mouldy bread or ſour drink, any rotten or corrupted ſcraps, which one would ſcarce throw to Doggs, that they bountifully beſtow upon

            <p>Again, ſome others there be who give not with a wicked mind, but infect and corrupt the oyle of their mercy, with the filth of their luxury, being as well prone to ſatisfie the deſires of their luſt, as they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to releive the wants and heare the cryes of the needy.

There be others who are not drown'd as the former in the mud of carnall luſts, but poure out their Oyle fruitleſly with this intent, that they may be ſeen and commended. But let me ask ſuch men this queſtion, what they mean by not following our Saviours In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction? <hi>Why does the left hand know what the right hand doeth?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 15.33.</note> Holy <hi>Iob</hi> compares ſuch men to <hi>an Olive that doth caſt her flowers</hi> And his compariſon is very fit, for (as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves) <q>The Olive Tree though it bring forth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloſſomes, yet if it be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a ſtrong and violent wind brings forth no fruit. So he that is then only mercifull to the needy when he hath beholders, or does it to be ſeen, he looſes the fruit of his good work by means of the blaſt of mens praiſe, at which he aim'd in beſtowing his Alines.</q> The elect ſervant of God, when he helps thoſe that want, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects

Neither doth he expect commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or praiſe, but from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who will be his reward and ſalvation. <q>Our charity to the poor (as St. Chryſ. doth expreſs it) hath Golden wings, but not Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks Feathers. It has admirers here on earth, but its rewarder is in heaven, whether it mounts with its golden wings and there finds Chriſt an advocate to cover its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, who relieved him in his poor members.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Charity is ſo far from deſiring to be known, that if it were poſſible it would hide and conceal its doings from the eyes of the al ſeeing God; indeed a man truly mercifull is not ſo carefull that others may know how much he gives, as he is that God may know it, who alone can make him a juſt requitall and full ſatisfaction. Therefore St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaid well, when he termed this bountifull mind to the poor and

Pride is the ruine and death of all vertues, the downfall of men and Angels. O God what a change once was there betweene Heaven and Earth. The moſt beautifull Angell of all was thrown downe from Heaven, and a poor moſt miſerable Begger
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51347:90"/>was carried by the Angells thither. For from whence proud Lucifer fell, thither did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> poore humble <hi>Lazarus</hi> aſcend, whom we beleeve to have rather numbred his vlcers, to have counted his boiles and botches, rather this, then to have caſt up or made any Account of his vertues. And I doubt not but that out of a Genuine contempt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his patience ſeem'd more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in others eyes then his owne.

Looke we downward to the earth, there we ſhall ſee a Pit which the Earth threatns unto us when we are dead, and though we now tread upon it with our feet, yet after a little while, our lofty heads ſhall be laid low in it. Look we upon our ſelves, we may behold a faire &amp; red Apple, like that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> in which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding its beauty, there lurks a worme which in time will eat and conſume that Apple at the heart: filth and rottenneſs and Death it ſelfe harbours even in our very bowells. Look we into our hearts, do we unbowell our conſciences; there we ſhall find Cages of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and dunghills of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a neſt of Snakes, Toads, and Vipers. Alas we abound in ſin and infirmities, and yet we are not vile

We are overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with miſeries, beſet with folly and ignorance, and yet we deſire to ſeeme happy, wiſe, and ſearn'd, and to be pointed at with the finger as if we were moſt eminent; Theſe conſiderations of our ſinfull frailty beget in the elect, a meane eſteem of themſelves, and the more they conſider their miſeries the more humble are they and vile in their owne eyes.

None of

In a word, Gods elect Children have throughly learn'd this leſſon in Chriſts School, that the ſcoffs of men cannot make them leſs in Gods eſteem, In whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion we are greater when we are little in the worlds favour. So great, and no greater is every man, as he is in the eyes of God who judges not according to mans Iudgement. We are little in Gods account if we be great in our owne, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if little in our owne eſteeme, vve are great in his. The deeper the Well is, the purer is the Water; And the eſtimation vve have of our ſelves is more pleaſing to God, by hovv much the more vile and mean it is. <hi>God brings downe the high loocks of the proud:</hi> and men of great aſpiring thoughts ſhall be brought to ſhame and confuſion.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Stephens</hi> mouth was open'd, Heavens Gates were unlock'd and opend, ſo that he preſently, <hi>Saw the Glory of God.</hi> What man is there that liveth, that whilſt he lives can ſee God and ſhall not ſee Death? This holy Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> vvas yet alive in the fleſh, vvhen he did partake of the beatificall viſion. O vvonderfull mercy worthy of all Admiration.

But let us weigh the cauſe why his reward was ſo haſtily beſtowd? It is this. Our remiſſion and pardoning of Injuries, our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deprecation and interceding for our Enemies is ſo gratefull and pleaſing to God, that now when <hi>Stephen</hi> was upon his knees, this moſt mercifull Lord layes aſide his dreadfull Majeſty, diſpences with his royall law of crowning after victory, prevents this firſt Martyr with a rare and extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and commands the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Queen of Heaven, Happineſs, to ſtep out of thoſe celeſtiall doores, to embrace this bleſſed Champion
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51347:99"/>in her Armes at the Threſhold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe doores, that ſo he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded his deadly Enemies, his perſecutors with love, and pour'd out prayers and teares to God in their behalf, might (contrary to the ſtatute law of Heaven) be call'd to triumph, before Death was fully conquer'd. And this is a royall priviledge indulged only to thoſe who can and do forget and forgive Injuries. Hence we may inferre, that to do an ill turne, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one is hurtfull to a man, and full of danger, for that thereby, he makes God his adverſary and loſeth his favour who is pleaſed with: and delights only in thoſe that can ſuffer patiently, and readily forgive an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. <hi>David</hi> a man of meekneſs and after Gods owne heart, who had fought with Lions, and Beares, and often got the conqueſt, yet he being ſo valiant, as that no feare or terrour could abate his couragious valour, when his raging and moſt cruell enemy <hi>Saul</hi> oftentimes fell into his hands, and was at his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

The ſoule that burnes hot with an eager deſire of revenge, when it departs out of the body and takes its flight to Heaven, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be repeld by Chriſt, who by his precept and practiſe taught us meekneſs, not raging malice; being a Teacher of ſubmiſſion, not of perſecution; the Maſter of Charity, (who did inſtruct us to pardon our enemies,) not of Hatred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; thoſe that practiſe theſe are none of his Diſciples, they belong
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51347:106"/>not unto Chriſt. But the revengfull ſoule wants both eyes and eares, it is deafe and blind, and carried whereſoever the violence of paſſion drawes it; of this conſtitution and humor were thoſe of whom we finde mention made in "<hi>Plautus,</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51347:106"/>as malice and hatred can make it. Give me leave, my Chriſtian Brethren, to ſpeake what is true, and what I repeat with greife.

            <p>When the good old man had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his prayer, the other was ſo aſtonied with a confuſed amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhame, that inſtantly he fell downe at the old mans feet: and being thus proſtrate, he wept bitterly, and promiſed that he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51347:109"/>would forgive his enemy, and not revenge himſelf, no not in word. And indeed this is the Command of our juſt God; this is the mark of Gods Sons, willingly and readily to pardon thoſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; and when they have an opportunity, to requite the offence with a beneficiall courteſie. <hi>See</hi> (ſayes St. Paul) <hi>that no man ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der evill for evill,</hi>

            <p>Theſe duties (good God) thou commandeſt, and largely doeſt thou promiſe; but O Lord how many be there that will not lend to thee an eare: how many are there in the World who prefer their luſt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred before thy word, and therefore they moſt audaciouſly profeſs, they will not leave their malice, nor by any threats, be Eſſeminated into a facility of pardoning an offence. Nothing is more pleaſant to them, then to pay their enemies with their owne Coyne; to requite wound for wound, and words for words. And if God ſhould do by them, as he did by <hi>Salomon,</hi> offer to give them what they did wiſh,
<note place="margin">1. K. 3.</note> I beleeve they would not as he did deſire wiſdom, rather Revenge. They undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would cry to God, and ſay; Lord give us the lives of our enemies, and it ſhall ſuffice us. Behold here a

            <p>
               <q>This deſire of Revenge (ſayes <hi>Tertullian</hi>) proceeds either from vaine-glory or malice.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51347:119"/>I muſt entreat all thoſe who ſhall peruſe this, and not love their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to tell me ingeniouſly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they beſeeve theſe things to be true: Certainly they vvill anſvver, affirmatively, unleſs they can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Chriſt vvill deceive us, or that Truth it ſelfe can lye. If then theſe things be true, nay moſt true, what wicked contumacy then are they guilty of, vvho out of an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpirit make a mock at Gods word and contemne his commands? Chriſt calls, and commands, <hi>Love not only your friends, but alſo your very enemies;</hi> if they have vvrong'd you, pardon and remit al their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

If you are fully minded not to caſt out this poyſon, enjoy your malice, but let me tell you for a certaine, doe what you will, take what courſe you pleaſe, you are in the road vvay to hell, and out of that vvhich leads to Heaven.

Every occaſion of ſin muſt be avoyded and ſhun'd, that we may run with more ſafety to the mark that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, and that is everlaſting happineſs. The prodigall.

               <q>Thoſe wanton toies, and fooliſh vanities, my ancient loves, with which I formerly too often dallied, theſe ſeiſed upon my thoughts, and ſpake as it were thus within me in ſilent, whiſpering to the eare of my fleſh. What will you now leave us?</q> The Good man left them, and ſhook off the yoak of their tempting inſtigations, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting with hatred his former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, that he became a nevv man, leading a life in all holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Godlineſs. It cannot be denyed, but that many of us do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes begin to lead a better life, but we only begin, vve ſpin not out this thread: vve continue not our
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51347:124"/>reſolutions to the end; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not in our beginnings, and firſt undertakings of Religious courſes, but fall back and returne to our old vomit and uncleaneſs. And I doubt not but that in many Chriſtians there might be found (if we would peirce into their ſecret intentions) pious indeavours, holy thoughts and good purpoſes, but moſt of us are like to the old <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> we (as they did) make good decrees, but faile for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in our executions, or if we begin to execute, we perſiſt not in our undertakings, We preſcribe to our ſelves very honeſt and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome wayes of living, but we are diſcouraged, and falter in thoſe wayes, by reaſon of any the leaſt trouble or moleſtation. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound great matters to our ſelves, and things that are holy and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but being entiſ'd by the alure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Rebellious fleſh, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the invitations of our looſe companions, or moved by the leaſt temptation from the Devill, we
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51347:125"/>preſently yeeld our ſelves captives; and without any the leaſt reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we ſuffer our ſelves to be draw'n back to our former polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſcovering hereby both our unſettledneſſe and impatiency. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps (my good Chriſtian brother) thou haſt decreed with thy ſelfe to live for the time to come a more chaſt and ſober life, to avoid every occaſion which may lead thee to ſin, as bad company, naughty hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or the like; It may be too thou haſt put on a reſolution to ſhut the caſements of thy ſoule, thine eyes from gazing on beauties, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of luſtfull affections, and to ſubdue the petulant humor of thy unruly fleſh. It is well, and perhaps thou haſt ſet forward one foot in the way of vertue, thou haſt begun to ſpeak modeſtly, and to lay aſide al wanton and Idle books, which are full of obſcene diſcourſes. All this is well. Thou haſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too reſolved to bridle thy haſty paſſion, to keep down thy choler, to refrain from anger, to caſt out of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51347:125"/>thy mind all hatred and envy, and malice againſt thy neighbour; very Good. Thou haſt alſo begun to rule thy Tongue, to be ſilent, when thy companions calumniate and ſlander others, to forbeare when they mock and ſcoff at mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities. All this is very good and agreeable to the rules of true repentance. But how far better is it to perſevere in thoſe good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? How many be there now, who yeſterday contain'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the bounds of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; repulſed the violent rage of Tongue and luſt, brake the ſtomack of their Anger; had the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves; who to day ruſh, <hi>(as an horſe into the battell)</hi> into their former looſeneſs, put their necks under the yoak of their luſts, give the Reines to their unbridled tongues, boile in Anger, and ſerve their vices as they did before; But let ſuch and all men know, That is not a true Repentance, which is not conſtant and firmely ſet upon good purpoſes. That which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51347:126"/>is rather an inconſtant, deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory levity of the mind. Oh what brave ſword-men, what fine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are wee! we ſhew much Art, dexterity in our skirmiſhes; we make great flouriſhes before hand, but when we are to fight in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt at ſharps, when we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with our adverſaries, and to ſhew our skill and cunning in guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſelves from their blowes, then we ſlinch and run away like cowards, and thoſe wounds which we ſhould avoid undauntedly in the field ſtanding, thoſe we receive in our backs, and flying the faces of our Antagoniſts. Againe, what brave Racers are wee! At our firſt ſetting forth we ſpread our Armes, and move our feet with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillity, till we ſweat by meanes of our labour and paine, and anon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are halfe way, we faint and falter and give over running. Alas thus do we poor ſilly mortalls. How often do we venture upon many brave undertakings, how many things do we begin with
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51347:126"/>praiſe and commendation, and ſometimes go on in acourſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, to the joy and comfort of our friends that love us, yet we languiſh by degrees, at length we fall, and finally lye in our accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſins. In vaine does the Tree flouriſh and triumph in its bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, promiſing much fruit, unleſs it bring it forth. The Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>builder layes the foundation to no purpoſe, unleſs he erect upon it walls and roofe, all which compleat and make a perfect houſe. What doth it profit the Mr. of a ſhip to ſet up the Maſt, to fit the tackling, open the Sayles, and order the men that uſe the Oares, all this care and induſtry will not advantage him, if he launch not the ſhip into the deep from the ſhoare, or make a ſhort returne ſo ſoone as it is laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? And truly we are moſt of us like to thoſe builders, who lay a foundation, but erect not an houſe upon it. With ſome unskilfull O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours, we begin with a plauſible exordium, but ſeldom come to a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51347:127"/>good concluſion. We often ſet up our ſailes with the fooliſh Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but ſo ſoone as ever a ſtorm begins to riſe, we returne to the Haven from whence we came. This ſaying is much and frequent in our mouths, I will do this or that, I will amend my evill courſes, &amp; yet we do juſt nothing, and mend too late when our Glaſs is run, and our time quite ſpent. when we receive worthily the Sacrament of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of our Lord Ieſus, then we have in a manner begun our race, then we have ſet footing in a new courſe, but how often is it ſeen (may it be ſpoken with griefe) that we run but halfe-way, and then either ſtand ſtill or lye downe panting, and weary of well-doing.</p>
            <p>And thus fainting in the mid'ſt of our courſe, we ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our dayes, not like thoſe who had made a ſolemne promiſe to God of forſaking their evill wayes. This promiſe we make when we partake of that heavenly banquet, I meane, the holy Euchariſt. Man is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:51347:127"/>counted the moſt prudent of all creatures, but <hi>Polybius</hi> once ſaid, he thought him the moſt fooliſh; for other creatures obſerve, where, and from whom they receive any hurt, and ſhun them.</p>
            <p>Therfore having eſcap'd the gin never ventures himſelfe in that place againe. The Wolfe will never reſt himſelfe in that hoie, where he has been hunted; the Dog re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members the Cudgell, wherewith he has been beaten; But man (as if he were made up of oblivion) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the dangers he has eſcap'd and will lay his hand upon the hole of that Aſpe which ſtung him; he will unadviſedly put his foot into that ſnare out of which he is eſcap'd, and which he knowes will be his ruine. God complaines by his Prophet <hi>Jſay</hi> of his peoples forgetfullneſs, where he ſayes, <hi>Thou haſt not laid theſe things to thy heart,</hi> neither haſt thou remembred thy latter end. Yet I ſaid when my people had don all this againſt mee, <hi>Returne, and they would not convert nor be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51347:145"/>by a Quire of Angells, when Chriſt was born, but it is not to be obtain'd eaſily but by much ſtrife and paine. This was preſignified by Gods giving his law to <hi>Moſes</hi> with the loud voice of a Trumpet,
<note place="margin">Ex. 19.</note> an inſtrument of War.</p>
            <p>A man would ſuppoſe that gentle and ſoft muſick had bin fitter for this religious work; The Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet fits better with the Camp then a Church. But to leave off theſe nice expoſtulations and diſputes, we muſt know that God did this to teach us, that <hi>as our life is a warfare,</hi> ſo we are cal'd by God not to ſit ſtill at eaſe, but to fight our battells againſt our ſinfull luſts, we are call'd by him who gave the Law to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which Law we cannot obſerve and keep, unleſs we oppoſe, and fight againſt the Law's Enemies, which are our luſts. None ever ſubdued his fleſh by flattering it, none ever conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an enticing Devill, or the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing world, but by reſiſting both
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51347:146"/>with thoſe weapons, which God preſcribes in his holy Scriptures. ſtrive then we muſt, and fight with every corrupt affection which is adverſe to Gods Law, and ſo to be eſteem'd an enemy. He that is only angry with his ſins and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours his affections, he cuts off the boughs of a bad tree, but ſpares the Root, &amp; ſo long as this remaines, the boughs will againe ſhoot out. Thus <hi>Chryſ.</hi> commenting upon thoſe words of our Saviour. <hi>He that looks upon a woman to luſt after her, has committed adultery with her in his heart,</hi> ſayes, that Chriſt in this precept forbids not only the diſeaſe it ſelfe, but ſtrikes alſo at the root of it. The root of Adulſtery is unchaſt luſt. And therefore he does not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Adultery, but concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeence likewiſe which is its Mother or Nurſe. So he forbids not murder alone, but Anger alſo which is oftentimes the ſpawne or cauſe of it, or contumelious and reproachfull ſpeeches which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51347:146"/>many quarrells, and the ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of much blood. Anger and love are two violent affections that admit of no lawes, but thoſe that are ſevere and ſerious: they are not eaſily tam'd by gentle and ſmooth precepts. Anger does not like other vices which ſollicite by flatteries; it ſuatcheth away our minds, and drives them furiouſly into dangers. And although ſcarce any man be found ſo cruell, who having wounded his enemy with a ſword, deſires to bury his hand in the vvound and never draw it out; yet Anger is ſuch a weapon that can hardly be dravvne out when it is driven in. Anger is dareing, and feares not to act any ſin, and having deſign'd a man for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is never pacified till it draws his hearts blood. An angry man is like the fire-ſtone which if it be ſtrook againſt the flint, ſpits fire immediatly, &amp; is hardly quench'd. <hi>An angry man ſtirreth up ſtriſe,</hi>

Beſide this odious and ſtaining ſin of luſt, there is another corrupt affection which beares a ſway in moſt of us, &amp; that is the deſire of money, a Spur to all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chneſs. This thirſt is ſo violent and hot, that it is not ſatisfied with gaine, but rather encreaſed by it: Neither does it leſſe torment the mind when it has obtain'd what it ſeeks, as when it ſeeks to obtaine what it coveteth. And when other ſins grow old with Age, this of Coveteouſneſſe bloomes, and bloſſomes, and is then in its youth and vigor, when a man is drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into his Grave.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51347:152"/>no man truſt himſelfe, for none has a more dangerous and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous enemy then himſelfe, with whom to make a truce is not very ſafe: Neither can it be ſecure for us to lay downe our weapons and ſhut them up in our Armories, untill we put off our fleſh and lay that up in our Graves.</p>
            <p>He that has a deſire to get the victory over his Adverſaries, muſt perpetually watch and ſleep in his Armes. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently to this purpoſe. <q>It is the greateſt pleaſure to a man to have overcome his pleaſures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be a greater and more noble victory then that which we obtaine over our luſts, and affections: for he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his enemy is indeed the ſtronger, but this is in reſpect of another, but he that overcomes his luſt, is ſtronger then himſelfe, in that he overpowers his owne weakneſs.</q>

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51347:153"/>he has reduc'd them to an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious concord. And a man predeſtin'd to ſalvation, never ceaſes to allay the tumults, and reconcile the differences between Reaſon and his affections, till he compoſe the quarrell in a religious peace; If we may beleeve <hi>Plato,</hi> 
               <q>our body is (as it were) an Harp,our Reaſon the Harper or Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, who now playes upon theſe ſtrings, anon upon thoſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it has to do vvith the eyes, ſometimes with the Tongue, in propoſing certaine Lawes and preſcriptions to both, now it ſtops the cares, then it binds the hands, and is ſtill employed in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and ordering the ſenſes; ſometimes an affection of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury begins to riſe, this is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſſ'd by caſting upon it the bridle of Chaſtity. At other times an affection of impatiency, does ſtart up and ſwell like a bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or bile; Reaſon lets not this alone, but launces it, and lets out the corruption.</q> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51347:153"/>a skillfull Muſitian as appeares by that confeſſion of his.

               </q> And thus Gods elect ones are principally employed in tuning their Inſtruments, in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up or letting down the pins. Now they ſtrive with their Anger then reprehend Envy, now they ſtir up and awaken their drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by and by they bridle their Laughter and wantonneſſe, and if griefe be predominant, they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate it with lenitives, with the comforts that do ſpring and ariſe from Gods promiſes, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his providence. With the forenam'd and like ſtrings of paſſion, Reaſon like a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt is ever buſied, remitting ſome, and intending others, till all at length they become harmonious, free from debate and diſſention. Thoſe that are mark'd for heaven, Gods choſen people never give way to their looſe affections, They are the greateſt Admirers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens vertues, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51347:154"/>Cenſurers of their owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and ever ſhew the leaſt pity to themſelves; for if upon a privy ſearch and enquiry into their owne boſomes they find any unlawfull deſire or any luſt, that domineers in their breſts, they preſently ſentence it to death and Crucifie it: This therefore is a ſigne that we are predeſtin'd to eternall life, if we crucifie the fleſh with its imbred vices and luſts.

In this word indeed there is miniſtred comfort to the Efect, and all manner of excuſe is taken from the reprobate; For when the ſignes and markes of our predeſtination are diſcovered, he that neglects them is manifeſtly convinced, that he diſregards the ſtate of his Soule, and makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Heaven, the Land of the living. By right ſuch a man ought to blame none but himſelfe who will not underſtand nor be ſaved. God has not by a blind Chance predeſtined theſe to Heaven, and thoſe to Hell. knowne unto the

               </note> And <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> ſaies, That good men are not neceſſitated to periſh, becauſe they are not predeſtinated, but therefore not predeſtinated to life, becauſe God foreſaw that by their wicked deeds they would deſerve death,
<note place="margin">Li. 1. <hi>ad ſimplic.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> conſents with <hi>Proſper</hi> in this; God ſaies he, did not hate <hi>Eſau</hi> as a man, but as a man full of ſin or as a notorious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, For God hates nothing in man but ſin; he ſaies alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place thus, It is ſin alone that obſtructs our way and ſtops our paſſage to Heaven: We all haſten and poſt to one end or marke, and there be divers paths and maine wayes in which we move and run to that end, and many periſh in their race. The way that leads to life is narrow and thorny: The way of perdition is ſpred with Roſes, ſoft and eaſie, it is a deſcent into pleaſant valleyes, whereas the other is climbing up of high and rugged Mountaines.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:51347:157"/>Truth it ſelfe, or Chriſt who is the truth calls unto us in the word,
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.27.</note> he exhorts and admoniſhes us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtraite Gate, for broad is the gate, and wide is the way that leades to perdition, and many there be who enter in it, but ſtrait is the Gate, and narrow is the way which leads to life, and few there be that find it.
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.23</note> In another place he does adviſe us to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, for I ſay unto you that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall ſtrive to enter in and ſhall not. Truly the way is narrow that leads to happineſs, it is ſo narrow that but one can go in it,
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> And that without a companion. For every one of us ſhall give an accompt to God for himſelfe.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.</note> And every one ſhall beare his owne burthen; every man ſhall be rewarded according to his owne workes. This overthrowes that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd opinion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning workes of Supererogation.</p>
            <p>Againe our Saviour even ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uttered theſe words,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20. et 22.</note> 
               <hi>Many
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51347:157"/>are called, but few are choſen.</hi> This one ſmall word, <hi>Few</hi> as if it were a terrible clap of Thunder, has rouſed a great part of the world from the Lethargie or dead ſleep of ſecurity. It has driven ſome out of populous Cities into Dens and Wilderneſſes: and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred thouſand Martyrs has it forced by a ſecret violence to expoſe themſelves to the furie of Tormentors, whereby they were caſt into Priſons, put upon racks, burnt at Stakes, hang'd upon Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, and devoured by beaſts? Their only voice was this, <hi>We feare not to die, but accompt death eaſy, ſo long as we hope to be glorified with the</hi> Few Elect. <hi>Let the ſword rage and drowne it ſelfe in our bloud, we weigh it not ſo long as we may be numbred among the Elect, who are few in number, but for ever bleſſed.</hi> And which of them durſt not ſay? If <hi>J alone</hi> could be hanged upon an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gibbets, I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:51347:158"/>this ſhamefull torment, If I could lay down an hundred necks upon the block, and ſubject them to the Hatchet, I would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract or withdraw one; To die an hundred deaths would be a paſtime to me, I ſhould eſteeme of my torments as Recreations and ſports, ſo long as I may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſociety of thoſe <hi>Few</hi> which ſhall raigne with Chriſt in everlaſting glory. From this ſpring did iſſue that generous and brave exclamation of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> let <hi>Fire and the Croſs, wild beaſts and all the torments that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill can invent, come and ſurpriſe me, ſo long as</hi> I <hi>may enjoy Chriſt.</hi> This little word <hi>Few</hi> utter'd by Chriſts owne mouth, has filled many with that horrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that though they were men of moſt impure lives, yet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the pleaſant Meadows of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie and voluptiouſneſs they ſhut themſelves into the houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſadneſs: thinking it better to be ſaved with a few, then
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51347:158"/>to periſh with many. It doth not leſſen our paine to periſh with a multitude. This Paucity of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved was in all ages propoſed for a caution unto us. Concerning this even <hi>Noe</hi> a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of righteouſneſs (ſo he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>) prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched an hundred yeares before the Flood,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> but all or moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtinate in their wickedneſs, out of that great &amp; infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men only eight perſons were ſaved in that wooden Priſon or ſhip (call it which you will) the Ark: And amongſt thoſe <hi>Few</hi> there was a <hi>Cham</hi> who was wicked. For as Roſes grow not without Prickles and Thornes, ſo the ungodly are ever mingled in the ſocietie of Gods Saints. And if God being about to overthrow <hi>Sodom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 10.</note> would upon <hi>Abrahams</hi> requeſt have ſpared that land, if he had found but ten righteous men in it, which could not be found, we muſt conclude that honeſty and vertue there was very ſcarce.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51347:159"/>Therefore the Angells charged <hi>Lot</hi> to make haſt out of it that he might be ſaved.
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> Thus out of the great flame in which the two moſt flouriſhing Cities of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were conſumed, only three eſcaped, and to this day the Signes of Gods wrath are extant in the places where thoſe Cities ſtood. But we have another ſtory in holy writ, which clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the paucity or fewneſs of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> led out of Aegypt ſix hundred thouſand men on foot, beſides Women and Children, a promiſcuous multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude alſo following the Campe, only two out of ſo great a number came into the fruitfull land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> to the reſt the wilderneſs was a capacious Grave, in which as in a Common burying place for the dead, many thouſand of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were interred.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Aegyptian Tyrant</hi> who purſued them with a bloody furie,
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> intending to ſtay their journey,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:51347:159"/>was with his whole Armie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the womb of the red <hi>Sea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier: 10.</note> Behold how many thouſand ſoules are here ſwallowed up by the devouring waves! Who will not feare thee <hi>O King</hi> of Nations? When the Children of Iſraell had corrupted themſelves in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a Calfe which they ſet up contrary to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<note place="margin">Exo. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> being full of wrath and griefe proclaimed, <q>He that is for the Lord, let him joyne himſelfe to me,</q> and in that there were ſlaine three and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. A great ſlaughter it was and only cauſed by that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Idol which they worſhipped, ſuch and ſo great is one ſin (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of Idolatry) in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the City of <hi>Iericho</hi> by compaſſing it ſeaven times,
<note place="margin">Ioſ 6.</note> and cauſing the people to make a great ſhout againſt it, whatſoever was in it both of men and beaſts, all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and were deſtroyed by fire and ſword, and at laſt the City it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:51347:160"/>ſelfe was turn'd to aſhes, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumed, only one houſe (which was <hi>Rahabs</hi>) being preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Gedeon</hi> prepared War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 7.</note> out of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Souldiers, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred only were choſen for that fight, the reſt being rejected. God meaſures not his people by their number but by their vertue and goodneſs, it is not a multitude of men, but good men that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him. Neither is the way to deſtruction very long, it is run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in a breath, by one deadly ſin we become guilty of high Treaſon againſt his divine Majeſty, and deſerve the eternall flames of Hel. Thus for one libidinous act,
<note place="margin">Iud 20.</note> forty thouſand of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and fifty thouſand and ſix hundred <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's</hi> were put to death and ſlain by the ſword.</p>

               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:51347:160"/>ſlaughter? we read v. 19. that there were ſlaine fifty thouſand, threeſcore and ten men. This ſcarcity of the Predeſtinate or thoſe that are Elect is no leſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet out unto us in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Samuel,</hi> where we read, that when <hi>Abſolon</hi> rebelled againſt his Father,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> and had rayſed a great Army againſt him, a Meſſenger ran to King <hi>David</hi> and told him, that all Iſraell followed after <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> and clave unto him with one heart, and with one joynt conſent. And when <hi>Sheba</hi> had ſtirred up a furious multitude againſt his King, immediatly after this there came another report to <hi>Davids</hi> eares, That all Iſraell was divided from <hi>David,</hi> and joynd to <hi>Sheba,</hi> Look into the world with a ſtrict obſervation, and you will find and ſee now the very ſame thing. Chriſt our Lord and King has ſhewed us a way to Heaven, a way be-ſprinckled with blood &amp; ſigned with the foot-ſteps of his bitter paſſion, his Head is covered with
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:51347:161"/>a Crowne of Thornes, and if we look upon him with the eye of meditation, we may ſee him carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reproachfull Croſs upon his innocent ſhoulders which did not become ſuch a burthen, laid upon him for our ſins, let us conſider too his wan and pale countenance, his ſad and mournfull eyes, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in teares mingled with blood thus attired; and in this ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full habit, he aſcended to Mount <hi>Calvarie,</hi> exhorting us to follow his example; and to beare the Croſs with patience and humility. But alas how few are his followers, how few are there amongſt us who do take up his Croſs, and by a chearfull ſuffering of affliction, conforme themſelves to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his meekneſs? The whole World lyeth in ſin and wickedneſſe: moſt men follow with their whole heart not <hi>Sheba,</hi> but <hi>Satan.</hi> There be but a few that go up to <hi>Golgotha</hi> with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> To this which has beene ſaid (to prove the ſmall number of
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51347:161"/>the predeſtinate) we may add that which we find recorded in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Samuel</hi> concerning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he had numbred the people,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.</note> God was ſo diſpleaſed with him, that he ſlew by the plague and peſtilence ſeventy thouſand men. And indeed all theſe ſad paſſages were ſhadowes of future things, and as it were a prologue and Exordium of that heavenly Sermon wherein Chriſt declared the paucity or fewneſſe of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7. Luk. 1.3.</note> Now take a Survey of the Jewes, recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from <hi>Abraham</hi> to the laſt day of the World, and you will eaſily perceive that the hundred forty and foure thouſand which are mentioned in the Apocalyps wil be ſcarce the thouſandth part of all the Iewes that might be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. So that we may conclude upon this ground that one Iew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thouſand ſhall not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

The wide gate is our owne Will, which we muſt renounce by a cheerefull and conſtant ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, and obedience to his Commandements. The broad way that leads to Hell is a worldly converſation, to live in ſurfeting &amp; drunkenneſs, to ſpend our dayes in Luxury and wantonneſs, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull and never to forget or forgive injuries, &amp;c. This is the common practiſe of the world; therefore Few there are that ſhall be ſaved We find a ſtory among the Popiſh Legends of which we may make ſome uſe; It is of <hi>Bertoldus a Franciſcan,</hi> an Eloquent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:51347:172"/>in Germany: This man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming in a Sermon with ſtrong invectives againſt a certaine ſin; there was a Woman then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent who heard this ſin ripp'd up and the foulneſs of it laid open, and Conſcious to her ſelfe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of the ſame, was ſtoken with ſo great ſorrow and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in her ſoule, that ſhe preſently in the mid'ſt of the people fell into a Swoon, but afterwards comming to her ſelfe againe, and ſtanding up with horrour in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and paleneſſe in her cheeks, ſhe related what ſhee had ſeene don at the Tribunall of God; but among other things ſhe affirmed this: That ſhee ſaw brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſixty thouſand ſoules of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Nations, Chriſtians and Barbarians who had died ſeverall deaths, and of all theſe but only three were ſaved, the reſt were throvvn dovvn to Hell to be for ever tormented.</p>
            <p>The truth of this ſtory vve will not now diſcuſſe, but let us all
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51347:172"/>beleive this to be moſt true, That many enter in at the broad gate, and many walk in the wide and ſpacious way that leads to perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſaid well to this purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. Hom. 24. et Tom. 5. Hom. 40.</note> gloſſing upon our Saviours words, There be many more that enter in at <hi>Hells Gate,</hi> but yet the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is greater, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Inhabitants be fewer; And how many think you are in our City that ſhall be ſaved? I know (ſaid he) that what I ſay will not be pleaſing to you; yet I will not forbeare to ſpeak it; Amongſt ſo many thouſands, there are ſcarce one hundred that ſhall be ſaved; Nay I doubt of that too: For what malice may we find in young men? what Idleneſs and drowſineſs in the auntient, &amp;c.

            <p>
